# hello-world
I am brand new to programming, i have started to learn the basics of html, css and javascript.  Being a little older i decided i wanted to try something diffrent and wanted to better my career.  I started with html and css, but was advised to focus more on javascript.  So i bought a book and i am working through it each day.  It is starting to make sense more and more each day.
